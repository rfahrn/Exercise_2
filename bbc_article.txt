Russian forces have already triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the east, reducing Mariupol to ruins, but they have failed to inflict defeat on Ukraine's military. Warning of a new onslaught on the east, President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed: "We will fight for every metre of our land."

Ukraine had already stationed its best-trained forces in the east because of an eight-year war with Russian-backed separatists. They are thought to have suffered heavy losses but are still a significant challenge to Russia's invading army.

When President Putin talks of Donbas, he is referring to Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. But he really means the entirety of two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border.

Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukraine's army in the east. They have taken control of Izyum - a strategic town on the road between Ukraine's second city Kharkiv and the separatist areas - and have bombarded a succession of Luhansk towns, including Rubizhne, Lysychansk, Popasna and Severodonetsk, destroying blocks of flats and killing civilians in their homes.

Civilians are being moved out ahead of the Russian advance. Local leader Serhiy Haidai said 20 children were led to safety from the basement of a kindergarten in Lysychansk on Thursday and some 200 civilians climbed on to buses in Severodonetsk.
